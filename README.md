# Overview

A simple web app using React combined Yelp's Fusion API. Initial goal is to acheive a MVP where users can browse and view details of wineries in the Niagara Region. Evenetually I'd like to incorperate a backend, and allow users to favourite wineries they'd like to visit or have visited, and make tasiting reccomendations in app.
